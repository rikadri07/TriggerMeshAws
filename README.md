# TriggerMesh to AWS Integration




## Introduction

TriggerMesh is a cloud-native integration platform that allows you to create event-driven workflows. This project demonstrates how to use TriggerMesh to connect various event sources to AWS services such as Lambda, S3, SNS, and more.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture_diagram.png)

1. **Event Source**: Any event source supported by TriggerMesh (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Webhooks).
2. **TriggerMesh**: Routes events from the source to AWS services.
3. **AWS Services**:

## Prerequisites

- TriggerMesh account
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured


```

### TriggerMesh Setup

1. **Create TriggerMesh Integration**: Log in to TriggerMesh and create a new integration.
2. **Configure Event Source**: Add your event source (e.g., GitHub, Slack, Webhook).
3. **Add AWS Target**: Configure AWS services as targets for your events. This can include Lambda, S3, SNS, etc.




2. **Configure TriggerMesh Targets**: Ensure your TriggerMesh integration points to the correct AWS targets with the necessary permissions.
